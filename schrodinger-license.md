"All material" is defined as everything influenced in any fashion by an observer of licensed material after the observer has observed the licensed material, including, but not limited to, any derivative, creative, or destructive works, any tangible or intangible things the observer comes in contact with, any tangible or intangible things that come in contact with things that the observer has come in contact with, any tangible or intangible things that come in contact with things that come in contact with things that the observer has come in contact with, to an infinite level of recursion.
