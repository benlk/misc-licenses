# The Schrödinger License r3

Copyright 2013-2016 Benjamin Lancaster Keith

The Schrödinger License is licensed under the terms of The Schrödinger License. 

## Definitions

1. "Observe" is defined in the quantum physics sense of the term.

2. "Observer" is defined as one who observes.

3. "All material" is defined as everything influenced in any fashion by an observer of licensed material after the observer has observed the licensed material, including, but not limited to, any derivative, creative, or destructive works, any tangible or intangible things the observer comes in contact with, any tangible or intangible things that come in contact with things that the observer has come in contact with, any tangible or intangible things that come in contact with things that come in contact with things that the observer has come in contact with, to an infinite level of recursion. 

## Terms

1. The licensed material may not be observed.

2. The licensed material may not simultaneously be observed and not observed.

3. The licensed material must simultaneously be observed and not observed.

4. Observing the licensed material will require the observer to license all material under The Schrödinger License.

## Exceptions

1. The Schrödinger License does not apply if the observer is a Schrödinger's Cat currently being observed in a Schrödinger's Box experiment.

2. The Schrödinger License does not apply to itself when The Schrödinger License is the object of discussion.

## Revisions

r3: Added Copyright message. If you can find a way to modify the Schrödinger License without breaking the license, you have the Schrödinger License's owner's permission to do so.

r2: Added Exception 2. The Schrödinger License can now be discussed and linked to for discussion without applying the license terms to The Schrödinger License, when The Schrödinger License is the subject of the discussion.

r1: Added Exception 1.

r0: Initial release.

## Historical note

Because the Schrödinger License r0 was released without the exception added in r2, everything in the light cone of commit https://github.com/benlk/misc-licenses/commit/0bbee5aff743e531e34bc101d133de8a748de874 is subject to r0 of the Schrödinger License. If you are not sure whether you are covered by [r0 of this license](https://github.com/benlk/misc-licenses/commit/0bbee5aff743e531e34bc101d133de8a748de874#diff-5d1c429753db03b47243ecd0538fcdc2e03b82411d562003455472e4a90d6465): calculate the time distance from 2:15 a.m. EDT July 29 2013 to the current time, multiply that by the speed of light, and draw a sphere with [that radius](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282%3A15+a.m.+EDT+Jul+29%2C+2013+to+today%29+*+speed+of+light) centered on the position of North America at 2:15 a.m. EDT July 29 2013. If you are within that sphere, you are covered by the license. If you were present on Earth at that time, you are covered by the license.
